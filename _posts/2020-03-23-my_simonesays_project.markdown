Let just start by saying this project was pretty fun, all the step I have taken worked pretty well. Taking one step at a time is the best way to approach it. First, create the backend and generate the necessary `rails` class. Second, create the frontEnd, this contains  `HTML`, `CSS`, and `javaScript` files. Last, in the javaScript files make all the necessary `iterations`.
