## Graduate's Goals

Working on this project was a lot of fun. During the process, I've learned many tricks and trades that will be quite useful in the future. The first trick I learned was how to check to see if every code is work without the need for testing.
Second, was how to bypass some features through a hack sort of. Third, was how to secure your code properly so no outside source can come in from the back door.

While, I was working on this project, I was wondering how I could use a debugger called `pry` to check and see if my line of code is working. Well, the first thought that came to mind was run `rspec` in the terminal. üòÇüòÇ that didn't work because there is no test created in the `spec` file to check specific code. My next thought was maybe in one of my get request I should put `binding.pry` and run `rackup` or `shotgun`  to see if that will work. üßê Getting closer, now all I need to do is go to the browser and type the route I place the code `binding.pry` in.

### I have succeeded!!
Now that I have discovered how to debug my code everything started to fall in place more efficiently.

## Securing The app

There are some hackers out there, so you need to secure your application. Knowing this I have learned how to make it quite a task to hack into my application. If your app involves a user creating accounts and posting new tweets, or in this case "Goals" you need to know how 'session' works. There is a gem called `bcrypt`, this gem is a password hashing function, it's job is to change your created password "Hello_is_my_password" into
`"$2a$12$HghvcXmaTwzNo6qvTxD9NO6fwRIWpHqieWh3lpkZ5n24UH.Ugpn4O"` yeah you get the picture. There is no way anyone can guess a password to an account if it's that long. Before you can use `bcrypt` tools you'll need to go to your `models` folder and add `has_secure_password` in the file that will hold the values for a user's account. There are other tasks you must do to get 'bcrypt' working. Those are making a file in your `db` folder to create a users table with the columns username and `password_digest`, so you can run `rake db:migrate` in the terminal and create the the database.

## Hacking and Patching

OK, now that the app is ready, let's run it using `rackup` and print the localhost link in the browser. Alright, everything is working as intended, but what if a hacker tries to edit or delete another user's post?
What if someone creates an account with the same username? These are things I didn't take into account. It was not until I asked someone to show me how you can get to the back door of my app.

How do you patch up those cracks and lock the back doors, so hackers will find it hard to sneak in?
Using the `if statements` is a good start to create restrictions, but there needs to be more. Remember earlier I mention the  `session` and the `bcrypt` tools, well its time to put them to work. First, I created helper methods `logged_in?` and `current_user`. The current_user method contains the `session` that is given a `user_id` or removed as soon as the person signs in or signs out. Current_user's goal is to find the session's `user_id`. The `logged_in?` method is used to check `if` the person is `logged_in?`. It also contains a session, but it's only goal is to see if the session has a user_id. With all these tools and helper method you can create real security for your app.
