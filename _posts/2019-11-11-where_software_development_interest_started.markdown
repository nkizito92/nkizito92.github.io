#### First Blog ever made lol

In middle school I caught a glisp of programming, but the interest started in my college years. I was first introduced to programming in middle school, HTML and CSS. I didn’t quite understand the languages at such an early age, but I indeed loved every moment of it.

It was later in my collegiate life I became greatly intrigued to programming. C++ opened my eyes to the world of coding and showed me that my creativity on a computer is limitless! The very first software application I created was a calculator using C++. The more knowledge I gained acquired me to develop more complex things, hence a game I created called “Don’t Get Hit.” After C++, Java advanced me to new heights in my world of coding. Java caught my eye because it is found in almost every electronic device. With Java, I also created a more sophisticated calculator along with a game called “Floppy Block”, which is simply an emulation of the trendiest game at its time “Flappy Bird”. As I venture more into the programming world, HTML became a strong suit for me. With HTML I became affiliated with the languages CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, and PHP. Using these languages, I have developed multiple websites.
