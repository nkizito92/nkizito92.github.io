Through Flatiron School, I have achieved a few major skills I believe are essential for success in the programming world. The First major skill I pickup was how to debug your code. Second, was iterating and improving on it. And third, was how to find the resources you need to get past the wall. These are all the skills I believe are essential in breaking through any obstacle in the programming field. 


### Debug Your Code

Whenever I'd get stuck in code or wondering if my program is receiving the data, I always wonder if there was a way to check your data. Well, fortunately, there is for every programming language out there. In `ruby`,  there's debugger gem called `pry`. With this, you can check your data where ever you put `binding.pry`. What this simple code does is pause the application at the line of code you have `binding.pry` in.  From there you can look at your `terminal` and type in the code or variable to see if they have any values. There, you will be able to decide what to do next.

##### DONT BE ASHAMED TO USE A DEBUGGER "REAL PROGRAMMERS USE DEBUGGERS"!!!

### Iterating 

Iterating is one major factor in programming. When you what certain acts to take place, because a different value was given that's when `iterating` is essential. Here is a simple real-life situation of `iteration`, the vehicle's default value is set to drive straight, now  `if` the driver turns the steering wheel counterclockwise  `condition`,  the vehicle will turn left `result`.  The value for the vehicle is set to turn left, because of the condition it meets. If it wasn't for the condition the vehicle would have continued to drive straight this is why iteration is a very important skill to have.

### Resources

Finding resources is essential in the programming field. You may be in the process of developing an application, but there are just two or more things that aren't working in your favor. This is where do your research comes in to play. Depending on what resource you are looking for you must know the right terms and place to find what you are looking for. For example, you want to specifically find a breed of dogs when you use the search engine in Google, instead of searching the breed "Jack Russell" you search "dog" or even "jack". Searching "dog" is a little better, because you may find the breed you are looking for down the line, but it may take a while, searching "jack", on the other hand, you may never find what you are looking for. Hmmm, maybe if you include "dog" when looking up "jack" you may find what you've been searching for all this time.

When it comes to programming or maybe anything in life, the skills you must use to be successful are one, having the ability to debug your code. Two, iterating through a task to get the result you want based on the conditions. And three, using the appropriate terms to find the resources you are searching for.
