Through I Flatiron School, I have aceived quite a few major skills and sharpend others. The First major, skill I pickup was how to debug your code. Second, was iterating and improving it. And third, was how to find the resources you need to get passed the wall. These are all the skills I believe are essential in breaking through any obstacle in the programming field. 


### Debug Your Code

When ever I'd get stuck in code, or wondered if my programed is receiveing the data, I aways wonder if there was a way to check your data. Well, fortunatally, there is for every programming language out there. In `ruby`  there's debugger gem called `pry`. With this you can check your data where every you put `binding.pry`. What this simple code does is pause the application at the line of code you have `binding.pry` in.  From there you can look at your `terminal` and type in the code or variable to see if they have any values. There, you will be able to decide what to do next.

#### DONT BE ASHAME TO USE A DEBUGGER "REAL PROGRAMMERS USE DEBUGGERS"!!!

### Iterating 

Iterating is one major factor in programming. When you what certain acts to take place, because a different value was given that's when `iterating` is essential. Here is a simple real life situation of `iteration`, the vehicle's default value is set to drive straight, now  `if` the driver turns the steering wheel counterclocks `condition`,  the vehicle will turn left `result`.  The value for the the vehicle is set to turn left, because the condition it meet.
